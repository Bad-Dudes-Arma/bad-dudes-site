In addition to the base game, you will need at least the Apex DLC. This includes the Tanoa map that we have a number of missions on. All other DLC is optional. 

When equipping gear from a DLC you do not own you will regularly be shown a nag screen asking you to buy the DLC. You can ignore the nag screen, abandon the piece of equipment, or trade it to another person during the mission. Unit roles in missions will usually be marked if any DLC items are in use. You will not be able to operate any vehicles from DLC you do not own but you will still be able enter them as a passenger.

Some DLC items are recommended. If you have any interest in playing roles related to their content consider purchasing them. Contact is recommended because it contains the Livonia map and once a sufficient number of Bad Dudes have the DLC we can begin using it for our missions.

Arma DLC regularly goes on sale on Steam and can be purchased in a bundle for an additional discount.
