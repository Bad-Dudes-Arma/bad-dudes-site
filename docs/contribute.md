This guide is incomplete! You can help finish it by contributing to the site repository on Github! See the footer below!

## Contributing to a single file

(This presumes you have a github account and can manage that much)
1. Go to the file you want to edit and click the pencil icon

2. Add the desired changes to the file and create an entry for the changes. Click the 'Propose file change' button

3. The comparison of the file shows up here. Verify your changes and click 'Create pull request'

4. Change the title and comments of the pull request if you wish and click 'Create pull request'

5. Wait for Oro or someone else who loves documentation so much they will also accept and review the work of others to accept the pull request or talk smack about it and request changes.
