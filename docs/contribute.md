This guide is incomplete! You can help finish it by contributing to the site repository on [Github](https://github.com/Bad-Dudes-Arma/bad-dudes-site)!
To contribute you can make edits directly on Github, clone the repository and run the project locally, or make text submissions directly to a site administrator.

### Requirements

* A github account.
* A basic familiarity with git or a willingness to learn.

### Github documentation
* [Editing files in a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)
* [Opening a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

### Editing directly on Github

#### Edit a file

Navigate to the file you want to edit and click the pencil icon to begin editing.

#### Fork the repo

Make your desired changes to the file and write a commit message summarizing the changes at the bottom. Select the option to create a new branch and give it a descriptive, but short, name. Click the `Propose file change` button. This process creates a fork of the repository under your own account that you control. Repo administrators will have access to this fork and will be able to directly make changes to it during the pull request process.

#### Review changes

You have now created your fork. A diff showing the changes that applying your fork to the original repository will make will be displayed. Verify your changes and make any further necessary edits to your fork.

#### Code review

Your code is now in review. At this stage comments may be made by others on necessary changes before your pull request can be merged. Once all concerns are addressed a repo administrator will approve and merge your pull request.

### Cloning the repository for local development

WIP

### Text submissions

If you are not inclined to learn to use git or github your submissions are still welcome! Write up documentation on a subject and submit it to Oronar on the discord server. If possible provide markup and example images but text only submissions are welcome as well.
