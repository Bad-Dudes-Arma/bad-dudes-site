We finally have documentation!

After a long dark age of passing information from person to person we have finally entered the age of written documentation! The initial release will contain information on how to setup Arma to play with Bad Dudes. The near future will hopefully include further contributions from myself and others with improvements and further guides on how to operate marginally better with Bad Dudes!
